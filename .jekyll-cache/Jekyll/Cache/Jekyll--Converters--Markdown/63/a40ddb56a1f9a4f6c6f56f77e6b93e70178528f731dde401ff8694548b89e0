I"1<p>Multicap funds are good as they are a mixture of large cap, midcap and small cap funds. Most of the multicap funds are doing good in the market but a mutual fund should not be selected only on returns but four to five criterias should be checked before taking a call. Hope it satifies your answer.</p>
